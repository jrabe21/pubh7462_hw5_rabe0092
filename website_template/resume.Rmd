### As a PhD student, I'm not actively looking for employment

However, I'm broadly interested in working as a wildlife ecologist through government agencies or academia focusing on predator-prey dynamics and conservation.

Professional Experience {data-icon=binoculars}
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Yellowstone Wolf, Cougar, and Elk Projects

Biological Technician and Field Crew Lead 

Yellowstone National Park, WY

2020 - 2017

As a full-time technician, I worked on the Yellowstone Wolf, Cougar, and Elk Projects for over 3 years. Thanks to the diversity of wildlife and world-renowned research opportunities, I was able to immerse myself in a wide range of projects. From watching wolves in the dead of winter from sunrise to sunset, to necropsying kills made by wolves and cougars the week before, to tracking animals from cars and fixed-wing planes; there was no shortage of field work to take part in. In my last two years, I helped lead many of these field operations day in and day out, managing data, field work, and the dozens of volunteers that help us throughout the year. 

### United States Fish and Wildlife Service - Directorate Fellowship Program (USFWS DFP)

Wildlife Fellow at Farallon National Wildlife Refuge

Fremont, CA

Summer 2016

As a wildlife fellow through the Directorate Fellowship Program, I was responsible for carrying out a diversity of tasks both in and out of the field in a highly independent setting. From a management perspective, my main task involved invasive plant control of a multitude of invasive plant species that negatively impacted seabird nesting habitat. Furthermore, I conducted applied research regarding invasive plant phenology, western gull nest disturbance assessments as a response to invasive plant treatment, and nocturnal callback surveys of the endangered Ashy-Storm Petrel to assess habitat use of artificial structures. While on the refuge, free time was spent assisting Point Blue Conservation Science with seabird banding through mist-netting and capture of chicks, diet watches and nest checks to assess breeding success, and assisting with landing operations to bring gear and personnel both on and off the island.


### The Wilds - Columbus Zoo & Aquarium

Wildlife Ecology and Conservation Research Intern

Cumberland, OH

Summer 2015

As a wildlife ecology intern at The Wilds, I was responsible for independently conducting field research, analyzing data, compiling a manuscript, and presenting my findings to facility professionals through both a formal and poster presentation. My independent work focused on assessing landscape characteristics of ruffed grouse habitat by walking line transects and recording the number of drumming individuals along right-of-ways and other forest edges over a period of three months. ArcGIS was then used in accordance with the National Land Cover Database to determine land cover around each transect. In addition to my own research project, I assisted one of my peers with conducting all of their camera trap surveys aimed at mapping the distribution of coyote, bobcat, and prey populations. Lastly, I gained basic skills in the capturing and sampling of salamanders while assisting peers with their research projects.
